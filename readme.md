# Laravel project "Joutes"

## Introduction

The "Joutes" project is a website created for the CPNV school to manage sports tournaments.

## Installation


**Homestead**

We decide to use Homestead for the project, this way everybody get the exactly same environement.

_"Laravel Homestead is an official, pre-packaged Vagrant box that provides you a wonderful development environment without requiring you to install PHP, a web server, and any other server software on your local machine."_


So we recommand to use it too. You can follow this [official laravel tutorial](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/homestead) for anything concerning the homestead installation if you don't any have it.

**Alternativ way**

If you really don't want to use homestead, you can just download our project and follow every next steps below **but :** To launch the server, you don't have a Vagrant box, so you have to use the command `php artisan serve` in the project directory to launch the laravel server.
