This project was created so the CPNV will be able to manage sport tournaments.

# Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

We worked on an environment with the following software :

- Ubuntu 16.04
- Git
- PHP 7.1
- Nginx
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Sqlite3
- Postgres
- Composer
- Node (With Yarn, PM2, Bower, Grunt and Gulp)
- Redis
- Memcached
- Beanstalkd

Not all the software on this list are required.

### Homestead

_"Laravel Homestead is an official, pre-packaged Vagrant box that provides you a wonderful development environment without requiring you to install PHP, a web server, and any other server software on your local machine."_

To allow us to have exactly the same work environment, we decided to use Homestead. If you wish to use it, which we recommand you do, you can follow the official documentation [here](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/homestead)

### Composer

_Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you._

If you don't have composer installed, execute the following commads to do so :  

```

php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php -r "if (hash_file('SHA384', 'composer-setup.php') === '55d6ead61b29c7bdee5cccfb50076874187bd9f21f65d8991d46ec5cc90518f447387fb9f76ebae1fbbacf329e583e30') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
php composer-setup.php
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"

```

### Node

_Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world._

if you don't have node.js installed, you can downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installation

First of all you need to clone the project on your local machine. You can either download the zip or use the git commands.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/CPNV-ES/Joutes.git
```

_All the following commands must be exectued in the project folder_

Now you need to install all the dependencies of the project.

```
$ composer install
$ npm install
```

Then you need to create a .env file. We recommand you copy the .env.example file.

```
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Once the file is created, you need to generate a new key.

```
$ php artisan key:generate
```

The project is almost up and running, in the .env file you'll need to configure the database information :

```
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=joutes
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

The only thing left to do is to create the DB. If you're using homestead, add the DB name in your Homestead.yaml file. Then you need to provision your VM.

```
$ vagrant provision
```

Once the DB created and configured, you'll need to run the migrations to create all the tables for the project.

```
$ php artisan migrate
```

For further details on how to migrate and seed our database, follow this [link](https://github.com/CPNV-ES/Joutes/wiki/Migrations-and-Seeds).

So there, now you're up and running and you can start messing arround with the project.

## Possible problems
### Homestead
If you've used homestead, it might redirect you to the wrong site, so you'll need to exectute the following command :

```
$ vagrant provision
```

### DB problems
If you run into an error "Class XYZ not found" after seeding the DB, execute the following command :

```
$ composer dump-autoload
```
